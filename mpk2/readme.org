* MPK from Suda sensei
The package consists of several programs:
** Input generation using ~gen~
   Input:
   - type :: the type of the generated matrix.
   - size ::
   - ghead ::
** Driver
   Input:
   - ghead :: input name.
   - npart :: partitions.
   - nlevel :: level.
   - nphase :: phase.
*** Operation
    The program executes a bunch of ~system()~ calls, to run other
    binaries.  The line executed is written using ~sprintf()~ to the
    ~line~ variable.  ~driver.c~ basically does the following:
    - ~mkdir ghead_npart_nlevel_nphase~ (line 46).
