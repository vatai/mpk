* MPK from Suda sensei
The package consists of several programs:
** Input generation using ~gen~
   Input:
   - type :: the type of the generated matrix.
   - size ::
   - ghead ::
** Driver
   Input:
   - ghead :: input name.
   - npart :: partitions.
   - nlevel :: level.
   - nphase :: phase.
*** Operation
    The program executes a bunch of ~system()~ calls, to run other
    binaries.  The line executed is written using ~sprintf()~ to the
    ~line~ variable.  ~driver.c~ basically does the following:
    - ~mkdir $GHEAD_$NPART_$NLEVEL_$NPHASE~ (line 46).
    - ~cp $GHEAD.g0 $DIR/g0~ where ~$DIR~ is the directory created in the
      previous ~system()~ call(line 51).
    - ~echo graph $GHEAD, npart $NPART, nlevel $NLEVEL, nphase $NPHASE
      > $DIR/log~ (line 57).
    - for ~$N~ from ~0~ to ~$NPHASE~:
