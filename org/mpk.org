* Introduction
  [1 page, example?, forward references]

** [Describe the problem]
  The speed of iterative solvers for large sparse linear systems on
  supercomputers is degraded by communication.
  
  1. CA-CG and similar algorithms (see section [[sec:problem]]).
  2. MPK needed for efficient CA solvers
      
  [State your contributions]
  1. Stencil operations - picture with skirts
  2. No solution for general matrices [in section "Our contributions"]
* Communication avoiding matrix powers kernels
  <<sec:problem>>
  [1 page]
  1) CG, with the problem of communication
  2) Lack of algorithm efficiently organising data 
* Our contribution 
  [list contributions, refutable, 2 pages]
  1) MPK algorithm suitable to calculate the base of the Krylov subspace
  2) Easily parralelisable
  3) Efficient [intuition]
* The details
** Overview of the main algorithm
** Partial results
** 
* Related work
* Conclusions and future work
  - Need of pre\-conditioner, numerical stability [???]
  - Parallelisation and measurements
  - GPU implementation
